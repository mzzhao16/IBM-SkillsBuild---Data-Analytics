# IBM-SkillsBuild---Data-Analytics

Add a data file
In this final step, you’ll learn how to upload a file with data into your repository.

Download and save this comma-separated values (CSV) file called “german_credit_data_biased_training.csv”(opens in a new tab) to your computer or device.(opens in a new tab)
A CSV file is a text file that has a specific format which allows data to be saved in a table structured format.
Note: This CSV file is a publicly available file that has sample, fictitious data in it for training purposes. It’s not intended for any other purposes. It’s actually available in an IBM GitHub repository, too!
Go to the GitHub repository you created.
From the Add file drop-down, select Upload files.
You can either drag the CSV file to your repository or select choose your files to find it on your computer or device.
Under the Commit changes section, put a name in the Add files via upload field.
For instance, since this is an activity, you could put “Example data” since it’s the first data set in your repository.
You can also put a short description in the Add an optional extended description field. It’s a good practice to keep your files organized.
Select Commit changes.
Now, you can view the CSV file in your repository! You can view your repository by selecting the link. Your repository is dated, stored, and has over 5000 lines, so GitHub states, “We can’t make this file beautiful and searchable because it’s too large.” You have data!
