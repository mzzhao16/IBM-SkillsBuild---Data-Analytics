# IBM-SkillsBuild---Data-Analytics
What can you do in GitHub?

People work with repositories in GitHub. A repository is like a folder for your project. You can have multiple public and private repositories in GitHub. Repositories can contain files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets. GitHub provides the revision history for all files in a repository.

In general, in GitHub you can:

Host your own open source project. To do this, you create an online repository and add files.
Contribute to an existing open source project that’s public. To do this, you access a copy of the project’s repository, make updates, and request a review of the changes to you want to contribute.
Next, you'll set-up your own GitHub account!


Activity: Open source in action!
In the following activity, you will navigate to GitHub(opens in a new tab) to create a free account and complete a few short tasks to create your first repository.

Note: User interfaces change frequently online, so you won’t see GitHub screen captures here. But, these step-by-step instructions are designed to guide you through the process. Over time, the steps might change slightly.

Disclaimer: In the following activity, you will be governed by the privacy policy of GitHub, and not that of IBM or IBM SkillsBuild.

Select START to begin. Be sure to keep the course open and come back to continue.

Step 1

Create a GitHub account
Creating a GitHub account is free. It’s like creating a new social media account or signing up for a newsletter.

Go to the GitHub Join page: https://github.com/join(opens in a new tab).
Complete the online form.
Type a username. This will display your username to everyone on GitHub. If a username is not available, then keep trying.
Type your email address and then create a password.
Verify your account.
Select Create account. 
Done! Now, you’re ready to explore GitHub(opens in a new tab), check out topics(opens in a new tab), or find out what’s trending(opens in a new tab). 

In the next step, you’ll create a repository.

Select Create account. 
Done! Now, you’re ready to explore GitHub(opens in a new tab), check out topics(opens in a new tab), or find out what’s trending(opens in a new tab). 

In the next step, you’ll create a repository.
Create a repository
Next, create your first repository so you can understand the structure of hosting files on GitHub for open source projects.

Go to the GitHub home page: https://github.com/(opens in a new tab). Make sure you are logged in.
Find “Recent Repositories” and select the New button.
The Create a new repository page displays. Notice that your username shows in the required Owner field.
Type a name in the Repository name field.
The repository name should be short and memorable. It should be meaningful to your project.
Since this is an activity, you could try using a repository name such as “Project 1”, or a name that GitHub suggests.  
Type a description in the Description field.
While this is optional, it’s very important for describing your project to the public.
Since this is an activity, you could type whatever you like, or maybe something like, “Good stuff resides here!”
In the spirit of open source, you can select Public to make your repository visible to anyone on the internet. You can still choose who can contribute.
You should check Add a README file. It’s a best practice and important component to the repository.
A README file(opens in a new tab) tells people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it.
Since this is an activity, you can make up some text for now and update it later.
You can explore but skip the Add .gitignore and Choose a license fields. You can leave the default selections.
Select Create repository.
Congratulations! You've just created a public repository in your personal GitHub account. Take a moment to check it out. Notice your README file and the icon to edit it.

Add a data file
In this final step, you’ll learn how to upload a file with data into your repository.

Download and save this comma-separated values (CSV) file called “german_credit_data_biased_training.csv”(opens in a new tab) to your computer or device.(opens in a new tab)
A CSV file is a text file that has a specific format which allows data to be saved in a table structured format.
Note: This CSV file is a publicly available file that has sample, fictitious data in it for training purposes. It’s not intended for any other purposes. It’s actually available in an IBM GitHub repository, too!
Go to the GitHub repository you created.
From the Add file drop-down, select Upload files.
You can either drag the CSV file to your repository or select choose your files to find it on your computer or device.
Under the Commit changes section, put a name in the Add files via upload field.
For instance, since this is an activity, you could put “Example data” since it’s the first data set in your repository.
You can also put a short description in the Add an optional extended description field. It’s a good practice to keep your files organized.
Select Commit changes.
Now, you can view the CSV file in your repository! You can view your repository by selecting the link. Your repository is dated, stored, and has over 5000 lines, so GitHub states, “We can’t make this file beautiful and searchable because it’s too large.” You have data!
